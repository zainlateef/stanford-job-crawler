# Stanford Job Crawler
## Automates job applications on [Stanfords Career Site](https://careersearch.stanford.edu/ "Stanfords Career Site")

#### **Instructions**
- You must have filled out at least one application on the site already. The crawler depends on prepopulated fields. **The program will not work if you have never filled out a job application on Stanfords Career Site**
- Open config.json, and enter the relevant information (username, password, full name, email address, and keywords that will be used in your job search)

- If this is your first time running the program, run `npm i` in the command line. This command will download Chromium if you do not have it already, so it may take some time

- Run `npm start` and watch the program go to work
